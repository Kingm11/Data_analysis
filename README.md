# Creating a histogram and scatterplot
## Overview
### The project demonstrates how to use Python and various libraries (including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to perform data analysis and create visualizations using the Iris dataset
## Data
### I imported the data ' Iris dataset' from a URL using Pandas' read_csv function , and then clean the data by removing any rows with missing or invalid values, and remove any duplicate rows.

## Visualization
### I created several visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including a histogram of the sepal length by class, a scatterplot of the sepal length and petal length colored by class

## Technologies Used
 
  .Matlotlib
  
  .Seaborn
## Steps
### 1.I define a function called data_analysis

This function takes a pandas dataframe as input and performs the following operations:

. Checks for missing values using Pandas isnull function, and drops them using dropna function if there are any.

. Checks for duplicate rows using Pandas duplicated function, and drops them using drop_duplicates function if there are any.

. Calculates the mean, mode, median, and standard deviation using Pandas mean, mode, median, and std functions, respectively.

. Prints the calculated statistics.

. Returns the cleaned dataframe.

### 2.Then i used read_csv function from Pandas to load it into a DataFrame

### 3.Then I called the data_analysis function to perform some data cleaning and analysis

### 4.Then i created  some visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
